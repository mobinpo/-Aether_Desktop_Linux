## What's new in 1.2.4

**Upgrade notice:** 1.2.4 brings the mobile edition's **AI assistant** to Windows — including a full chat page whose assistant can *apply* tuning settings for you — rebuilds the entire settings area as the mobile **hub-and-subpage menu**, bundles **Aether Core 1.9.0**, and fixes a setting that never did anything: a pinned **address range** was handed to the engine and read by nobody. Saved profiles load unchanged, and the desktop version is `1.2.4` across `tauri.conf.json`, `package.json`, the embedded manifest and the installer script.

### New in this release

**An AI assistant, ported from Aether Mobile 1.2.9.** A ✨ button next to every setting explains what that setting does on this machine, plus an Assistant page with a chat, a connection advisor that reads a redacted log excerpt, and a settings advisor whose suggestions pass a hard allowlist before anything is written. Six boundaries make it safe to ship in a censorship-circumvention tool:

* **The key is sealed by Windows, not by us.** `secrets.bin` is written through DPAPI (`CryptProtectData`, `CRYPTPROTECT_UI_FORBIDDEN`), so the ciphertext is worthless on another account or machine — the real equivalent of the Android Keystore seal the mobile edition uses. It is a separate store from `profile.json`, so *Reset all settings* does not take the key with it.
* **AI traffic uses the tunnel.** Requests are dialled through the app's own local SOCKS5 proxy with the host name sent as `ATYP=DOMAIN`, so the exit resolves `generativelanguage.googleapis.com` instead of the operator's resolver — a query that would both fail and announce intent. A gate refuses to send anything while the tunnel is down, and says why.
* **What leaves the device is filtered, not merely shortened.** Secret-shaped strings are replaced (the user's own Gemini key included), public IPv4 is masked to /16 and IPv6 to /32, WARP `device=` enrolment ids and bare UUIDs are dropped, loopback and private ranges are kept because `127.0.0.1:1819` is the most diagnostic string in the log, and the excerpt is size-capped.
* **One model allowlist, applied at four points**: the fresh `models.list` response, the cached list replayed at startup, the default pick, and the id that actually reaches `generateContent`. Filtering only the first is the bug this file exists to prevent.
* **The model cannot write security settings.** Only keys in `WRITABLE` are applied; an unknown key is rejected and logged rather than ignored; `accessSecret` and `accessToken` are deliberately absent; and every value is type- and range-checked before the profile's own `normalize` runs. The allowlist is derived from `ConnectionProfile`, not copied from the Android field names, because a copied list would have silently rejected every suggestion while telling the user it was applied.
* **The chat can write even less, and only on your click.** Settings proposed in a conversation pass a narrower allowlist than the advisor's, are re-validated at the moment you press Apply rather than trusted from when the answer arrived, and are written through the one gate that also persists the profile and revises the running session. The model proposes; it never applies.

**Chat is its own tab, with everything the mobile edition has.** Four ready-made questions on the empty page, your message on screen the moment you press send, copy on any answer, editing a message you already sent, deleting one or several, *Try again* on a message that never went out, and *Stop* for an answer in flight. A failed request becomes a retryable bubble carrying a translated sentence with Google's raw text kept underneath as detail — not an anonymous line in an error bar. Nothing is deleted without a confirmation that names the count, whether it is one bubble or the whole conversation. The ✨ explanation of any setting ends with *Did not understand? Ask the assistant*, which carries the question — and the explanation you just read — into this tab.

**The assistant can change settings for you.** Ask for a change and the answer arrives with a proposal card: every entry as `setting: old → new` with the model's own one-line reason, an **Apply** button, and a note that tunnel settings are handed to the engine at start-up, so they take effect on the next connect. The settings pages refresh the moment the write lands — the profile has one source of truth, Rust, which announces what it wrote, and the front end re-reads it before saving an edit of its own, so a change applied from the chat cannot be overwritten by a stale copy. Pressing Apply confirms the reconnect in a dialog rather than a line of small print, because the single most important sentence in the feature — that what you just approved is not live yet — must not be something you can scroll past.

Two rules make this safe. A proposal is validated against the allowlist **before it is drawn**, so a change the app would refuse never appears as a button that does nothing. And the chat's allowlist is deliberately **narrower than the advisor's**: the network backend, the upstream proxy, routing rules, split tunnelling, a manual endpoint, LAN sharing, the kill switch and every credential are not writable from a conversation, because those decide which traffic is protected and where it goes — a writable upstream proxy is a writable *"send all of this user's traffic through a host of my choosing"*, and a `direct` routing rule reads like a performance tip while being a de-anonymisation. Tuning is writable: protocol, obfuscation strength, MTU, fragmentation, keepalive, DNS, IP version, ECH, MASQUE-over-HTTP/2, IPv6 leak protection and reconnect behaviour.

**The settings area is now the mobile menu.** A hub of grouped rows — icon, title, subtitle, current value, chevron, and a per-row ✨ — opening subpages, with the old flat *Advanced* page gone and the reset row as a separate confirmed action. Hub and subpages are rendered from one section definition, so no control exists twice and storage behaviour cannot drift between the two. A jsdom test asserts that every field carries exactly one ✨, that displayed values are human-readable rather than raw enum names, that edits reach the profile store, and that the ✨ bubble refuses to call the model when the gate is closed.

**Aether Core 1.8.0 → 1.9.0.** The upgrade is a real three-way merge — upstream 1.9.0, this repository's patched 1.8.0, and the recorded 1.8.0 baseline — with 20 conflicts resolved and none left; the merged core type-checks and passes its own suite at 265 tests. Upstream absorbed the 1.2.3 throughput work (the rx/tx window split, the HTTP/2 send path, capsule batching), so the `masque_h2.rs` patch was **dropped** rather than carried: keeping it would have meant maintaining a fork of code upstream now owns, and `sync-core.sh` no longer merges that file. What upstream did not absorb still ships as a patch and now carries `AETHER-APP-PATCH` markers in the source, so the next upgrade cannot lose it quietly: CUBIC selection in smoltcp (pinned by the `socket-tcp-cubic` feature), the packet-queue depth cap, and the split `SO_RCVBUF`/`SO_SNDBUF` budgets. `CoreCaps::for_version` compares with `>=`, so every 1.5.0 and 1.7.0 capability stays enabled.

**Fixed: a pinned address range did nothing.** Endpoint mode *Manual range* sent `AETHER_SCAN_CIDRS`, `AETHER_MASQUE_CIDRS` and `AETHER_WG_CIDRS` — and no core version has ever read them, so a typed range was swept over the engine's own built-in ranges instead. Both scanners now honour them (the protocol-specific variable first, `AETHER_SCAN_CIDRS` as the shared fallback):

* an entry is validated before use, and `10.0.0.0/64` is rejected — the engine's parser accepts any prefix that fits in a `u8` and then collapses it to a single address, so a mistyped range used to become one silent host;
* a bare address becomes a one-host range, and the order you typed is preserved;
* built-in seed addresses outside the pinned range are no longer probed, because seeds are probed first and the tunnel would otherwise still land on an address you did not ask for — seeds *inside* the range are kept, so start-up stays fast;
* the IPv4 address embedded in a WARP IPv6 address comes from your range too;
* with nothing valid left, the built-in behaviour returns: an empty scan means never connecting, which no one typing a range is asking for.

**Upgrade note:** saved profiles load untouched. The AI layer is inert until you enter a key, and every AI control is additive — no existing setting changed its default, its name, or its meaning.

<summary>Version 1.2.3 — bundled Aether Core 1.8.0</summary>

**Upgrade notice:** 1.2.3 adds the **Aether → Psiphon** chained transport backend — the capability of Aether Mobile 1.2.8, brought to Windows with the same method — bundles **Aether Core 1.8.0**, and gives the exit-country picker a flag on every row. Saved profiles load unchanged, and the desktop version stays `1.2.3` across `tauri.conf.json`, `package.json` and the installer script.

### New in this release

**Aether → Psiphon, a chained transport backend** (Advanced → *Backend*). A two-hop path that keeps Aether's obfuscated transport on the first hop and takes its exit from an ordinary hosting address.

**An exit-country picker covering all 56 Psiphon egress regions**, with the country's flag on every row, fully keyboard-operable, and complete flag artwork across the whole region list.

**A filtering-server watchdog with exit-region steering**, brought over from the mobile edition with the same thresholds, blacklist and rotation grace window.

**The Psiphon stage shipped inside both installers** — `psiphon-tunnel-core`, built in CI from a pinned upstream tag, for x64 and x86.

**Aether Core 1.8.0**, with its complete source and build baseline in the repository.

**A throughput profile tuned for desktop links**: per-flow receive windows sized to a desktop bandwidth-delay product, CUBIC congestion control on every tunnelled flow, batched WireGuard encapsulation, data-plane socket buffers applied on Windows, an endpoint-quality budget for endpoint selection, and a new `[uplink]` telemetry line in the diagnostics log.

### New capabilities in detail

**Aether → Psiphon, the chained backend (brought over from Aether Mobile 1.2.8):**

```text
stage 1   Aether engine  → SOCKS5 127.0.0.1:1819     (no data path yet)
stage 2   Psiphon        → SOCKS5 127.0.0.1:1825     dials out through 1819
then      bridge + system proxy → 127.0.0.1:1825     exit = Psiphon
```

Aether's exits are Cloudflare WARP anycast addresses, and a large set of destinations serves a different view of the internet from them. The chain takes the **exit** from an ordinary hosting address while keeping Aether's obfuscated transport on the **first hop**, which is the hop that has to survive the local network. Single-hop Psiphon is deliberately absent: the chain exists precisely because the first hop is the one that needs Aether.

What came across from the mobile edition: the Psiphon config keys, including `UpstreamProxyUrl`, so **every** connection Psiphon makes — server-list fetches included — leaves through stage 1 and the chain cannot dial out directly; two-pass establishment (your country first, then no region filter with a fresh datastore), because `EgressRegion` is a **hard** filter; following the port Psiphon **actually** bound (`ListeningSocksProxyPort`) rather than dictating it; a stage-1 gate that proves the engine is a working SOCKS5 proxy before stage 2 starts, so a failure is reported where it happened; a 150-second verification window for a chained session, sized for two hops warming up; and the filtering-server watchdog with the same thresholds, blacklist, region steering and rotation grace window, so a deliberate server change is never read as a session death.

Android's third layer (`PsiphonSocksFront`, with udpgw, a dedicated DNS lane, QUIC carriage and AAAA suppression) is deliberately not part of the Windows design: it exists only because Android's tun2socks carries all UDP and DNS with SOCKS5 `UDP ASSOCIATE`, which Psiphon's local proxy does not speak. The Windows data path is the WinINET system proxy feeding the local bridge — TCP-only and IPv4-only by construction — and it asks stage 2 for nothing but `CONNECT`. One layer fewer is one failure point fewer.

**The exit country carries flags.** The control is a real listbox: every row is an inline SVG flag plus the country name, *Automatic* gets a globe so it is never the odd row out, the menu flips above the button when there is no room below, and it is fully keyboard-operable (arrows, Home/End, PageUp/PageDown, type-ahead over 56 countries, Enter, Escape). Inline SVG rather than emoji, because Windows ships no regional-indicator font — the same approach the IP badge uses. All 56 egress regions have artwork, Moldova included, so flag coverage of the region list is complete.

**A throughput profile tuned for desktop links.** The engine now sizes the data plane for a PC on a fat line rather than for a phone:

* the per-flow smoltcp **receive window** is sized separately from the send buffer and set to a desktop bandwidth-delay product (1 MB on a high tier), because a flow can never download faster than window / RTT;
* every tunnelled flow runs **CUBIC** congestion control, selected per socket and pinned by the `socket-tcp-cubic` feature so the choice cannot be dropped silently;
* outbound packets are **encapsulated in bursts** under a single boringtun session acquisition, so the packet rate scales with bursts instead of with scheduler hand-offs;
* `SO_RCVBUF` and `SO_SNDBUF` are **applied on Windows** to every data-plane datagram socket, sized as independent budgets — the receive side generous, the send side a latency bound;
* the netstack's app→network backlog is ordered **per flow**, with its own per-pass budget for control messages, so one busy flow cannot hold up the others;
* the device transmit ring holds a burst across a retry instead of shedding it, and the packet handoff queues are bounded in packets rather than inherited from the application queue depth;
* endpoint selection carries an **RTT budget** (`AETHER_SCAN_GOOD_RTT_MS`, `AETHER_QUICK_RECONNECT_MAX_RTT_MS`, `AETHER_QUICK_RECONNECT_MAX_HANDSHAKE_MS`; set any to `0` to disable), plus a floor that guarantees a rescan can only ever return an endpoint at least as fast as the cached one it replaced;
* the diagnostics log gains an `[uplink <peer>]` line every 15 seconds — packets, KB/s, the socket buffers the OS actually granted, and how often and how long the writer waited — and the performance-profile line now reports `udp socket rcv/snd=` and `netstack tcp tx/rx=` separately.

**Core 1.7.0 → 1.8.0:** `native/aether` sits on the 1.8.0 tag. `cli.rs`, `config.rs` and `consts.rs` are byte-for-byte identical between the two versions, so no flag or environment variable changed and `CoreCaps::for_version` (which compares with `>=`) keeps every 1.7 capability enabled. The sync script's baseline moved to 1.8.0 with it, and the throughput work above is registered with that script so a later core upgrade rebases it instead of dropping it.

**Upgrade note:** saved profiles load untouched. `backend` defaults to `AETHER` through `#[serde(default)]`, so the default behaviour is exactly 1.2.2's; the chained backend is a deliberate choice in Advanced → *Transport*. A saved exit country still resolves, because the region codes are identical to the mobile edition's.

<summary>Version 1.2.2 — bundled Aether Core 1.7.0</summary>

**Upgrade notice:** Upgrade to 1.2.2 for the bundled Aether Core 1.7.0. Domain routing rules now match the real host name behind the Wintun driver, Aether can dial out through another proxy or VPN on the same PC, and a device identity Cloudflare has stopped accepting is replaced instead of leaving you with a tunnel that handshakes but carries nothing. Every 1.2.0 and 1.2.1 protection stays enabled.

### Short comparison with 1.2.1

**Added:** the complete Aether Core 1.7.0 source and build baseline; an **Upstream proxy** control (`--upstream`) for chaining Aether behind another VPN or proxy already running on the machine; host-name matching for domain routing rules, read from the TLS server name or HTTP `Host` header; automatic replacement of a refused WARP identity; and a 1.7.0 capability gate covering the new flag and the new environment variables.

**Changed:** the desktop release is now 1.2.2; the root `CORE_VERSION`, the vendored `native/aether/CORE_VERSION` and the sync baseline are 1.7.0; an HTTP upstream proxy switches MASQUE to HTTP/2 automatically because HTTP CONNECT cannot carry UDP; the `--upstream` value is masked in the persistent log alongside the Zero Trust secrets; and WARP×2 (`gool`) now builds its two hops on two different Cloudflare edges.

**Preserved:** mandatory WebRTC and IPv6 fail-closed protection, the browser/network kill-switch, the three-target watchdog, exact proxy/PAC restoration, bounded shutdown, in-memory-only Zero Trust secrets, and the rule that a flag or variable is never sent to an engine that does not understand it.

### Detailed changes

**Core 1.7.0 integration:** `native/aether` contains the supplied 1.7.0 engine and its Quiche dependency. The desktop build, portable payload, About panel, rollback path, and CI core artifact all resolve the same `CORE_VERSION`, and the sync baseline for the patched probers was reseeded from 1.7.0.

**Upstream proxy (new):** Advanced → *Upstream proxy* accepts `socks5://host:port`, `socks5://user:pass@host:port`, `http://host:port` or a bare `host:port` (read as SOCKS5). The engine then dials every outbound connection — the endpoint scan, registration calls and the ECH lookup included — through that proxy. The address is validated in the UI and again in Rust, so an unusable value is never handed to the engine: the engine would only log one line and silently continue without a proxy, which is exactly the failure a user cannot see. A SOCKS5 proxy with UDP associate carries MASQUE, WireGuard and WARP×2; an HTTP proxy is TCP-only, so MASQUE is moved to HTTP/2 for you and the panel says so.

**Domain routing rules now work behind Wintun:** on Windows the data plane is always the TUN driver, so the local proxy used to receive a bare IP address and every domain rule quietly missed. Core 1.7.0 reads the name from the first bytes of the connection (TLS SNI or HTTP `Host`) and decides on that, while still connecting to the address the client asked for. The new *Match domain rules by real host name* switch is on by default and only turns the behaviour off.

**A refused identity is replaced, not tolerated:** Cloudflare can stop accepting a saved device. The handshake keeps succeeding in that state and no traffic passes. The engine now detects the refusal and registers a fresh device; the new *Replace a refused identity* switch is on by default and lets you opt out and be told instead.

**WARP×2 uses two distinct edges:** nested WARP now picks two different Cloudflare endpoints for the outer and inner hop and rescans instead of tunnelling an edge through itself. Expect an occasional extra scan round on very restrictive networks, especially with a narrow manual address range.

**Version gate extended:** `CoreCaps` gained 1.7.0 capabilities. On an older pinned core the new flag and variables are never sent and the matching UI sections are disabled with an explanation, exactly like the 1.5.0 features.

**Logging:** `--upstream` joins `--access-secret`, `--access-token` and `--access-email` in the redaction list, so proxy credentials never reach the rotating log file.

<summary>Version 1.2.1 — bundled Aether Core 1.6.0</summary>

**Upgrade notice:** Upgrade to 1.2.1 for the bundled Aether Core 1.6.0, stronger tunnel validation, and automatic engine-level recovery. All 1.2.0 leak protections remain enabled.

### Short comparison with 1.2.0

**Added:** the complete Aether Core 1.6.0 source and build baseline, end-to-end data-plane validation before a gateway is trusted, automatic MASQUE/WireGuard recovery, last-good-gateway reuse, MASQUE HTTP/2 ClientHello fragmentation, and updated bilingual release documentation.

**Changed:** the desktop release is now 1.2.1, the core baseline and bundled CORE_VERSION are 1.6.0, CI builds the supplied 1.6.0 engine source, and rollback/sync metadata starts from that same verified baseline.

### Detailed changes

**Core 1.6.0 integration:** `native/aether` now contains the supplied 1.6.0 engine and its Quiche dependency. The desktop build, portable payload, About panel, rollback path, and CI core artifact all resolve the same `CORE_VERSION`.

**Connection reliability:** Core 1.6.0 validates real data flow before opening the local proxy, reconnects MASQUE and WireGuard after tunnel loss, and retries the last working gateway before launching a full scan.

**Censorship resistance:** MASQUE can fall back from HTTP/3 to HTTP/2 and optionally fragment TLS ClientHello. Existing desktop controls for HTTP/2, fragmentation, ECH, quick reconnect, keepalive, Zero Trust, routing, and in-tunnel DNS remain wired to the engine.

**Mandatory leak protection:** WebRTC protection is no longer an editable option. Browser policy and elevated firewall enforcement block direct STUN/TURN UDP before a session is reported safe.

**IPv6 protection:** Global IPv6 traffic is routed through the protected path when available and blocked fail-closed otherwise. DNS and tunnel verification run before Connected is shown.

**Kill-switch:** Browser fallback traffic is blocked while the protected session is unavailable. Explicit disconnect removes only Aether's rules and restores the user's original proxy/PAC settings byte-for-byte.

**Connection watchdog:** Every 30 seconds, three independent end-to-end SOCKS5 targets are checked in a background worker. The engine restarts only after three failed rounds in a row.

**UI and shutdown performance:** The shell renders before IPC, initial requests run in parallel, tab listeners are released, verbose engine TLS logging is disabled, and native cleanup is ordered and bounded.

<summary>Version 1.1.0 — parity with engine core 1.5.0</summary>

This release brings the bundled engine to **Aether Core 1.5.0** and adds a full UI for the
three user-facing features that release introduced:

- **Zero Trust (WARP for organizations)** — connect as a managed device of a Cloudflare
  Zero Trust organization. Three sign-in methods: email code, service token, or an existing
  access token. Optional Gateway proxy (off by default, because it logs your browsing).
- **Routing rules** — block destinations outright, or send them out of your real interface
  instead of the tunnel (banking apps, LAN services, domestic sites).
- **In-tunnel DNS** — pick the resolvers used inside the tunnel.

Zero Trust secrets are kept **in memory only**, never written to disk, and masked in logs.
A core version gate makes sure 1.5.0 flags are only passed to an engine that understands them.

<summary>Version 1.0.0 — first desktop release</summary>

This is the **first** release of Aether for Windows. It is version `1.0.0` because the
desktop edition starts its own version line, independent of the Android app.

Every feature of the Android edition is implemented here, with nothing left out.

### Interface

- Identical design, colour palette and icon to the mobile edition (always dark theme)
- Adapted for large desktop displays: two-column layout with a persistent side rail
- Custom Windows 11-style title bar (minimise / maximise / close) — double-clicking it
  maximises/restores, like any native Windows window
- Full right-to-left support
- Fully bilingual interface — English and فارسی — switchable live from the Advanced tab;
  the choice is stored outside the profile, so "Reset to defaults" never changes your language

### Connection

- Connect button with the same **8 states** as Android:
  Disconnected · Starting engine · Connecting · Verifying · Connected · Reconnecting · Disconnecting · Connection failed
- Protocols: `Smart` (automatic pick — same name as the mobile edition) · `MASQUE` · `WireGuard` · `WARP×2`
- Scan modes: Turbo · Balanced · Thorough · Stealth · Ironclad
- IPv4, IPv6 or dual-stack
- Smart automatic protocol fallback when a protocol fails
- Automatic reconnect (capped at 5 attempts, exactly as on Android)
- Live connection details: protocol, endpoint, latency, uptime
- Traffic panel: live per-second download/upload rates plus session totals
- IP badge with a country flag — "Your IP" while disconnected, the tunnel's "Server IP"
  once connected. Flags are built-in SVGs (75+ countries, neutral globe fallback), because
  Windows has no emoji flag font

### Advanced settings

| Setting | Values |
|---|---|
| Noize | Off · Light · Firewall · Balanced · GFW · Aggressive |
| Endpoint | Auto · Manual peer · Manual range |
| MTU | presets plus a free numeric field (default 1280) |
| Keepalive | presets plus a free numeric field |
| Fragment | on / off |
| ECH | on / off |
| MASQUE HTTP/2 | on / off |
| Quick reconnect | on / off |
| Split tunnelling | Off · Include · Exclude |
| Language | English · فارسی |

Split tunnelling selects applications by executable name instead of Android package name —
the only place where the desktop edition differs, because Windows has no package names.

A **Reset to defaults** button restores every setting above to its factory value —
the UI language is deliberately left untouched.

### Network sharing

- Share the tunnel with other devices on your local network
- SOCKS5 on port `10810`, HTTP on port `10811` (same ports as the Android edition)
- Binds only to the detected LAN address, never to every interface
- Endpoint addresses shown in the app with one-click copy
- Both ports auto-detect the protocol — each one accepts HTTP **and** SOCKS5,
  so either port works in either field

### Diagnostics

- **Run test** — the same live self-test as Android: the checks update in place
  (PENDING → RUNNING → PASS / FAIL) under a colour-coded overall verdict
- **Environment check** — a six-point report, identical in meaning to the Android panel:
  1. Engine binary present
  2. Wintun driver present
  3. Administrator rights
  4. Local SOCKS5 port reachable
  5. Real tunnel egress verified (SOCKS5 handshake plus an outbound request)
  6. Profile sanity
- Live, colour-coded log console (E / W / I / D levels) that refreshes every second
- **Copy logs** (with a confirmation toast) and **Clear** actions

### Windows-specific behaviour

- Real system-wide tunnel using the official, Microsoft-signed **Wintun** driver —
  the desktop equivalent of Android's `VpnService`
- Windows Firewall rule configured automatically during installation, removed on uninstall
- Single-instance launch: reopening focuses the existing window
- Statically linked — no Visual C++ Redistributable required
- WebView2 installed automatically if missing
- On connect, the Windows system proxy (WinINET — what Edge/Chrome/Firefox call the
  "system proxy") is pointed at a local HTTP↔SOCKS5 bridge so system traffic really
  flows through the tunnel; it is reverted on disconnect, on errors and on exit

### About panel

- App version, core engine version and CPU architecture at a glance
- Expandable credits card — links to the upstream Cluvex Studio project (GitHub · Telegram)
  and to the Windows edition, with the upstream feature list and what this build adds
- Links open in your default browser

### Deliberately absent

- **Proxy Mode** — not meaningful on Windows, so it was left out by design.
  The build pipeline actively fails if anyone reintroduces it.
- **In-app updater** — removed. The About panel links to the GitHub Releases page instead.

|---|---|
| `Aether-Setup-1.2.4-x64.exe` | Windows 64-bit — graphical installer with uninstaller (recommended) |
| `Aether-Setup-1.2.4-x86.exe` | Windows 32-bit — graphical installer with uninstaller |

**Requirements:** Windows 10 build 1809 (October 2018 Update) or newer.
Establishing the tunnel requires Administrator rights, because a network adapter must be
created — the direct equivalent of Android's VPN permission prompt.

The portable edition keeps its settings and logs next to the executable, so it leaves no
trace elsewhere on the machine.

## Technology

| Layer | Choice | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Shell | **Tauri 2** | Uses the system WebView2, so the installer stays a few megabytes instead of ~100 MB with Electron |
| Logic | **Rust** | The Aether core engine is already Rust, so the app and the engine share one toolchain |
| Interface | HTML / CSS / vanilla JS, bundled by **Vite** | Reproduces the Compose design exactly, with no framework overhead |
| Tunnel | **Wintun** | The official WireGuard driver for Windows — signed by Microsoft |
| Installer | **Inno Setup 6** | Modern resizable wizard, bilingual, real uninstaller |
| Automation | **GitHub Actions** | Every build, test, package and publish step runs without human involvement |

## Building it yourself

You do not need to. Pushing to `main` produces every artifact automatically.
See [SETUP.md](SETUP.md) for the step-by-step repository setup guide.

## Licence

MIT — see [LICENSE](LICENSE).
Bundles the Wintun driver under its own licence.

### Elevation requirement

Aether Desktop 1.2.3 embeds a Windows `requireAdministrator` manifest. Windows therefore
shows the UAC prompt every time the app starts, before any engine, proxy, browser policy or
firewall rule is touched. This is intentional: starting unelevated would make the WebRTC
kill-switch incomplete. The installer is already administrator-only; this requirement now
also covers portable copies and direct launches.

## Important reminder

To get the best result on Android or Windows:

- Wait 1 to 3 minutes on each protocol. Connection time depends on the operator and region.
- Test different protocols and settings because DPI behavior varies by SIM, region, city, and network.
- On mobile data, toggle Airplane mode several times to obtain a different IP range, then retry.
- On Wi-Fi, turn the modem off for 1 to 2 minutes to obtain a different IP range, then retry.
- If it still does not connect, this VPN may not be compatible with that network.
- Different results across users are expected because operator DPI policies differ.
