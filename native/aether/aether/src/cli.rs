Aether — a censorship circumvention client. It finds a way out of a filtered
network, opens an encrypted tunnel, and serves it as a local SOCKS5 proxy.

Usage:
  aether [OPTIONS]
  aether help              show this text

Run it with no options and it asks for what it needs: protocol, scan mode, IP
version. Every question has a flag, and every flag has an environment variable
of its own. Setting either one is what stops the question being asked, and a
flag beats a variable.

  aether                                   answer the questions as they come
  aether --masque --turbo -4               nothing asked, straight to work
  aether --wg --thorough --noize gfw       classic wireguard on a strict network
  aether --gool --wiw-outer 162.159.192.1:2408 --wiw-inner 188.114.96.1:2408
  aether --mim                             two masque hops, for a different exit

Connection:
  --bind <addr>            local SOCKS5 listen address (default 127.0.0.1:1819)
  --http-proxy <addr>      also expose an HTTP CONNECT proxy on this address
                           (off by default, e.g. 127.0.0.1:1820)
  --upstream <url>         dial out through a proxy already running here, e.g.
                           socks5://127.0.0.1:1080 or http://user:pass@host:8080
  --mark <n>               put this firewall mark (SO_MARK) on every socket aether
                           opens to the internet, e.g. 0xff, so a tun front end on
                           the same Linux router can let them past instead of
                           looping them back in (Linux and Android, needs root or
                           CAP_NET_ADMIN)
  --quick-reconnect        auto-accept reconnecting with the last known working gateway
  --no-quick-reconnect     always scan fresh, ignore any saved last-connection gateway
  -4                       scan/connect over IPv4 only (default)
  -6                       scan/connect over IPv6 only
  --dual                   scan/connect over both IPv4 and IPv6
  --ip <v4|v6|both>        the same choice written out
  --peer <ip:port>         force a MASQUE/WireGuard peer, skip scanning
  --wg-peer <ip:port>      force a WireGuard peer (warp-in-warp outer), skip scanning

Protocol:
  --masque                 use MASQUE over QUIC/HTTP-3 (default)
  --wg, --wireguard, --warp
                           use classic WireGuard
  --gool, --wiw            use WARP-in-WARP (wireguard tunneled in wireguard)
  --mim, --masque-in-masque
                           use MASQUE-in-MASQUE: a masque tunnel carried inside
                           another one, which changes the address you come out
                           of the way gool does, on the same carrier for both
                           hops (HTTP/3 in HTTP/3, or --h2 for HTTP/2 in HTTP/2)
  --protocol <name>        masque | wg | gool | mim

WARP-in-WARP endpoints:
  Both hops are found by the scan unless you name them here. The port is
  required: which port gets through is exactly what differs between networks,
  so none is assumed for you. Name one hop and the scan finds the other,
  keeping your address out of the sweep. The two hops must be different
  addresses, and naming one selects warp-in-warp on its own, so --gool
  alongside is optional.
  --wiw-outer <ip:port>    the outer hop, the one your network sees
  --wiw-inner <ip:port>    the inner hop, reached through the outer one
  --wiw-peers <out[,in]>   both hops in one value, or only the outer one
  --wiw-scan               scan for both, ignoring any endpoint left in the
                           environment

MASQUE-in-MASQUE endpoints:
  The outer hop is found by the scan and the inner one is picked for you, both
  unless you name them here. The port is required, and the two hops must be
  different addresses. Naming one selects masque-in-masque on its own.
  --mim-outer <ip:port>    the outer hop, the one your network sees
  --mim-inner <ip:port>    the inner hop, reached through the outer one
  --mim-peers <out[,in]>   both hops in one value, or only the outer one
  --mim-scan               find the outer hop by scanning, ignoring any endpoint
                           left in the environment

Scan mode:
  --scan <mode>            turbo | balanced | thorough | stealth | ironclad
  --turbo                  stop at the first candidate that answers
  --balanced               default: collect a few, keep the fastest
  --thorough               sweep whole ranges, for when everything looks blocked
  --stealth                few probes in flight, for networks that notice scanning
  --ironclad               open a real tunnel and make a real HTTP request per
                           candidate, so a gateway is only trusted once it has
                           genuinely carried traffic

Obfuscation:
  --noize <profile>        off | light | firewall | balanced | gfw | aggressive
                           firewall is the default for MASQUE, balanced for
                           WireGuard and gool; reach for gfw when the default
                           does not get through

MASQUE transport:
  --h2, --http2            use HTTP/2 (TCP) instead of HTTP/3 (QUIC)
  --h3, --quic             use HTTP/3 (QUIC), without asking
  --no-quic-v2             do not send the QUIC v2 version-negotiation opener
                           (it is on by default; it opens a path for HTTP/3 on
                           networks that block QUIC v1 but let QUIC v2 through)
  --h2-peer <ip:port>      override the peer used for the HTTP/2 transport
  --ech <auto|base64>      enable Encrypted Client Hello
  --no-data-check          skip the end-to-end data-plane validation
  --validate-secs <n>      seconds to wait for data-plane validation (default 10)
  --startup-secs <n>       total MASQUE startup deadline (default 30)
  --reconnect-secs <n>     delay before reconnecting after a tunnel drop (default 2)
  --dns <list>             resolvers used inside the tunnel (default 1.1.1.1,1.0.0.1)
  --fragment               fragment the TLS ClientHello on the HTTP/2 transport
  --fragment-size <n|a-b>  fragment chunk size in bytes (default 16-32)
  --fragment-delay <n|a-b> delay between fragments in ms (default 2-10)

WireGuard:
  --keepalive <n>          persistent keepalive interval in seconds (default 5)
  --no-profile-retry       don't retry other obfuscation profiles during scan

Tor:
  Three ways to use tor, all needing a build made with the tor feature:
  cargo build --release --features tor

  --tor                    carry tor inside the tunnel: aether -> warp -> tor ->
                           internet. The usual proxy keeps the warp exit and a
                           second one, on --tor-bind, comes out of tor. Any
                           transport carries it, with nothing in between, so
                           --wg --tor has the wireguard tunnel carry tor itself
  --tor-reverse            the other way round: dial the tunnel through tor, so
                           warp is reached from a tor exit and your network never
                           sees warp. Tor carries tcp only and the wireguard
                           endpoints of warp answer on udp alone, so this runs
                           masque over http/2 and refuses --wg and --gool
  --tor-only               no tunnel at all: the proxy on --bind is plain tor
  --tor-bind <addr>        where the tor proxy listens with --tor and
                           --tor-reverse (default 127.0.0.1:1820)
  --tor-dir <path>         where tor keeps its directory cache and state
                           (default <config>-tor beside the identity file)

  On a network that blocks tor, aether fetches its own bridges from bridgedb and
  finds the pluggable transports already on this machine, tor browser's included.
  Nothing below is needed for that; it is there to override what it picks.

  --tor-bridges            go to bridges at once, without trying tor plainly first
  --no-tor-bridges         never use bridges, however blocked the network looks
  --tor-bridge <line>      a bridge line of your own, instead of the fetched ones.
                           Repeat it for more than one, e.g.
                           --tor-bridge \"obfs4 1.2.3.4:443 FINGERPRINT cert=... iat-mode=0\"
  --tor-pt [name=]<path>   the pluggable transport binary a bridge needs, e.g.
                           --tor-pt /usr/bin/lyrebird (obfs4 is assumed) or
                           --tor-pt snowflake=/usr/bin/snowflake-client
  --tor-pt-dir <path>      another folder to look in for those binaries

Zero Trust (WARP for organizations):
  --team <name>            enrol into a Zero Trust organization by team name
  --access-id <id>         service token client id (headless enrolment)
  --access-secret <secret> service token client secret (headless enrolment)
  --access-email <addr>    sign in with a one-time code emailed to this address
  --access-token <jwt>     an enrolment token you already obtained by signing in
                           at https://<team>.cloudflareaccess.com/warp
  --gateway                send http and https through the organization's gateway
                           proxy so its filtering and logging apply (off by default:
                           it adds a hop inside the tunnel and logs your browsing)

Routing (which traffic goes where):
  --route-block <list>     never let these reach the network at all
  --route-direct <list>    send these straight out, bypassing the tunnel
  --routes <path>          load both lists from a file with [block] and [direct]
                           sections
                           list entries are comma or newline separated and may be:
                             example.com          the name and every subdomain
                             full:example.com     that exact name only
                             keyword:doubleclick  any name containing it
                             regexp:^ad[0-9]+     a regular expression
                             10.0.0.0/8           a network, or a bare address
                             port:25              a port, or port:3000-3010
                             private              lan, loopback and cgnat space
                           block is checked first, then direct, otherwise the
                           tunnel is used

Config files:
  --config <path>          base identity config path (default aether.toml)
  --wg-config <path>       identity config path for WireGuard
  --masque-config <path>   identity config path for MASQUE
                           warp-in-warp adds a second identity of its own beside
                           the wireguard one, named <config>-secondary.toml

Advanced:
  --tls-groups <list>      TLS key share groups, e.g. \"P-256:X25519:P-384\"
  --perf <low|medium|high> force a resource profile instead of auto-detecting from cpu/ram
                           (low: routers/small boards, medium: typical desktop, high: servers)
  --log-level <level>      error | warn | info | debug | trace (default info)
                           info: connection stages, validation, reconnects, retries
                           debug: adds per-tunnel internals useful for troubleshooting
                           trace: everything, including per-packet noise
  --verbose                shortcut for --log-level debug (RUST_LOG overrides both)

  -v, --version            show version and exit
  -h, --help, help         show this help and exit

Environment variables:
  Every flag above has one, for scripts and services. The last few have no flag
  of their own.

  curl -x socks5h://127.0.0.1:1819 https://www.cloudflare.com/cdn-cgi/trace

The reply should show a Cloudflare colo and warp=on. The proxy has no
authentication, so bind it to 0.0.0.0 only when you mean to share the tunnel
with your network.
