//! Live latency for the home-screen badge — ported from the mobile edition's
//! `core/PingMonitor.kt` (Aether Mobile 1.2.8-r3 → r7).
//!
//! # Why this module exists (the "ping goes over 1000, sometimes 3000" report)
//!
//! The desktop build measured latency the way the mobile build used to, and it
//! inherited every one of the defects mobile already root-caused:
//!
//! 1. **It opened a brand new connection for every measurement and reported how
//!    long that took.** Through a chained `Aether → Psiphon` session that number
//!    is not latency, it is: the local SOCKS5 handshake, *plus* Psiphon opening a
//!    NEW SSH `direct-tcpip` channel across BOTH hops, *plus* the remote TCP
//!    handshake. The channel open is the expensive term and it queues behind
//!    whatever the tunnel is already carrying — which is exactly how a healthy
//!    ~200 ms path reads as 1637 ms (the screenshot) or 3000 ms.
//!
//! 2. **It generated the load it then displayed.** One dial every 15 s means a
//!    fresh SSH channel through both hops, forever. The field log carries the
//!    bill directly: `channel dial timeout: direct-tcpip` and
//!    `port forward failures for qkhOScJt: 2`. A diagnostic that manufactures
//!    the failure it reports is worse than no diagnostic.
//!
//! 3. **It probed a fresh dial on port 80 and every refusal was scored against
//!    the exit.** `psiphon_health` counts refused destinations as evidence of
//!    filtering, so the app's own probe helped convict a working server and
//!    trigger a rotation that killed every live flow.
//!
//! 4. **The first sample after connecting was the self-test's own HTTP fetch**,
//!    timed during the busiest second of the session, and it then never changed
//!    until the next probe. That is the 1637 ms in the screenshot.
//!
//! # What this does instead (mobile r5 + r6 + r7, in one place)
//!
//! * The probe session is dialled **once** and kept warm. A measurement is an
//!   HTTP `HEAD` keep-alive round trip on a connection that already exists: one
//!   packet out, one packet back, zero channel opens. The dial cost is still
//!   recorded, as [`last_setup_ms`], where it belongs — it is a useful number
//!   about the control path, and it is not the ping.
//! * Port **443**, not 53 and not 80: 443 is the one port an exit cannot refuse
//!   and still be an exit. Every target is also registered with
//!   [`crate::psiphon_health`] as a self-probe, so a refusal can never again be
//!   read as evidence about the server.
//! * The **first** round trip on a freshly dialled session is not a ping either
//!   (it rides a connection whose own handshake just queued behind everything
//!   the tunnel was carrying), so a re-warm takes a confirming sample and
//!   reports the lower of the two.
//! * A **steady-state outlier** is re-checked against the session's floor before
//!   it is published, and every sample is logged with the floor beside it, so a
//!   screenshot can always be reconciled against the log.
//!
//! The probe deliberately goes through [`crate::engine::exit_socks_port`], which
//! is the port the *finished* pipeline exposes — stage 2 in a chained session.
//! Probing stage 1 would measure the first hop only and say nothing about the
//! path the user's traffic actually takes.
